# iOS Architecture, One Skill at a Time — Outline

*A prequel to The Modular iOS Playbook. The reader finishes with a disciplined, tested MVVM-C
monolith — plus an AI skill library that can rebuild any part of it on demand — the app the
Playbook will pick up on its first page.*

The title means it both ways: each chapter grows a skill the reader keeps (an extraction, a
testing pattern, a judgment call) and mints a literal AI skill the project keeps — one row of
the ledger retired, one skill gained, until the architecture is something both the team and
its tools know how to build.

> **Contract with the sequel:** the Playbook will be revised so its Chapter 1 monolith IS this
> book's end state (that revision is planned separately). The prequel therefore owns the road
> from "one giant view" to "well-factored MVVM-C monolith"; the Playbook owns the road from
> there to compiler-enforced modules.

## Why this book

Almost every architecture book starts at chapter three of the real story: the app already has
models, view models, a navigation layer, tidy folders. This book is chapters one and two — the
craft of getting there. It begins with everything crammed into a single SwiftUI view and, one
Single Responsibility Principle extraction at a time, arrives at a monolith with a clear
architecture: **MVVM-C** — views that only render, view models that shape data for
presentation and hold screen state, and a coordinator that owns navigation.

Two habits get installed along the way, chapter by chapter:

- **Tests are not a chapter; they are a habit.** Every time a responsibility gets its own
  type, that chapter tests it — because *testability is the proof that the extraction worked*.
- **Conventions are not tribal knowledge; they are skills.** Every standard the reader adopts
  gets codified, right then, into an **AI skill** — a short, versioned instruction file an AI
  coding assistant can execute — so the *next* model, view model, route, or feature is built
  to the same standard by asking for it. The reader ends the book with a skill library that
  is the executable documentation of their architecture.

No SwiftPM packages, no repositories, no use cases, no dependency graphs. One target, one
team, one job per type — and the taste to stop there.

## Audience and prerequisites

You can build SwiftUI screens, manage `@State`, and call an API with async/await — but your
projects grow into one enormous view file and you can feel it. You use (or want to use) an AI
coding assistant and suspect it could do more than autocomplete. This book teaches structure,
judgment, testing as you go, codifying conventions, and restraint. It does not teach Swift or
SwiftUI. The running examples use Claude Code-style skills (a folder of `SKILL.md` files plus
a project `CLAUDE.md` rulebook), but the pattern ports to any assistant that reads
project-level instructions.

## The narrative

A solo founder builds **iTunesSearchApp** — Music search, then Podcasts — from weekend
prototype to the v1 a two-person startup ships at the start of The Modular iOS Playbook. The
founder works alongside an AI assistant the whole way, and keeps noticing the same thing:
*the assistant is exactly as good as the conventions it's been given.* Every chapter opens
with a real moment in that growth (a crash, a feature request, a bug that ships twice, an AI
suggestion that ignores a standard nobody wrote down) that motivates exactly one extraction.

## The recurring devices

**1. The responsibility ledger.** Chapter 1 writes down every job the one-and-only view is
doing. Each chapter retires exactly one row. The epilogue shows the empty ledger — and then
asks what the compiler thinks of all these tidy boundaries. (Answer: nothing. That's the
sequel.)

| # | Job the view is doing | Retired in |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Parse API responses | Ch 2 — Models |
| 2 | Talk to the network | Ch 3 — API client |
| 3 | Render every pixel of the screen | Ch 4 — View decomposition |
| 4 | Shape data for display + hold screen state | Ch 5 — View models |
| 5 | Be the whole app | Ch 6 — Second feature |
| 6 | Define the app's look | Ch 7 — Design language |
| 7 | Decide where to go next | Ch 8 — Coordinator |
| 8 | Log, track, report, and flag | Ch 9 — Service contracts |
| 9 | Describe the project itself | Ch 10 — project.yml |

**2. The "Prove it" beat.** Every chapter that isolates a responsibility closes by testing
the type it just created — right there, while the seam is fresh: *extract → inject what it
needs → prove it in milliseconds*. Chapters whose output isn't unit-testable logic (pure
rendering, tokens) say so honestly and use the right feedback tool instead (previews).

**3. The "Codify it" beat.** After the proof comes the skill: the chapter distills the
standard it just established — naming, file placement, required tests, the things reviewers
would otherwise repeat forever — into a skill file the AI assistant applies from then on. The
rhythm completes: *extract → prove → codify*. Each skill is small (a page), states the
convention and its **why**, points at one exemplar file in the codebase, and lists the
acceptance checks (which the "Prove it" tests provide). Later skills compose earlier ones,
so by Ch 6 "add a feature" is one request. The skill library grows in lockstep with the
ledger — one row retired, one skill gained.

| Chapter | Skill gained |
|---|---|
| Ch 1 | `CLAUDE.md` rulebook seeded (+ empty `.claude/skills/` as a promise) |
| Ch 2 | `add-model` |
| Ch 3 | `add-endpoint` |
| Ch 4 | `extract-subview` |
| Ch 5 | `add-view-model` |
| Ch 6 | `add-feature` (composes add-model, add-endpoint, add-view-model, extract-subview) |
| Ch 7 | `add-design-token` / `add-component` |
| Ch 8 | `add-route` |
| Ch 9 | `add-analytics-event` / `add-service` |
| Ch 10 | `update-project` + the library becomes team onboarding |

## Chapters

### Ch 1 — The One-File App
**Beat:** Friday night idea, Sunday night TestFlight build. A single `ContentView` holds an
inline `URLSession` call, `JSONSerialization` dictionaries, hex color literals, magic
paddings, and a `Bool` for every screen condition. The AI assistant, asked to "add a
podcasts screen," cheerfully offers to duplicate all of it — it has no standards to follow
because none exist. The chapter is honest: *this is the right way to start* — shipping beat
structure. Introduce SRP as the book's lens and open the responsibility ledger. **Prove it:**
the founder tries to write a single unit test for "durations show as minutes:seconds" — and
can't; nothing exists to instantiate except the entire screen. The empty test target stays in
the project as a promise. **Codify it:** the other promise — a `CLAUDE.md` with the only rule
so far ("we ship; structure must earn its place") and an empty `.claude/skills/` folder. The
thesis lands: *an unwritten convention doesn't exist — not for the next developer, and not
for the AI.* **Trap left open:** everything.

### Ch 2 — Models: Give Data a Type
**Beat:** the first crash — a missing dictionary key, found by a user. **Extraction:**
`Codable` structs (`Track`), decoded once at the boundary; optionality modeled honestly.
`Models/` appears. **Prove it:** the first real tests — decode fixture JSON (happy case,
missing artwork URL, malformed date); the crash becomes a regression test. **Codify it:**
`add-model` — the book's first skill, and the template for all that follow: the convention
(Codable struct, decode at the boundary, honest optionals), the why (this exact crash), the
exemplar (`Track.swift`), the acceptance checks (fixtures + decoding tests exist and pass).
The founder asks the assistant for the next model and watches it arrive *with its fixtures*.
**Ledger:** the view stops being a parser. **Trap:** it still fetches.

### Ch 3 — Networking: One Client, One Job
**Beat:** the search endpoint needs a new parameter and the change touches view code.
**Extraction:** `iTunesAPIClient` — URL building, async/await, status codes, typed errors —
fronted by a small protocol (`SearchClient`) and *handed to* whoever needs it, not grabbed as
a global. **Prove it:** tests for the pure logic — URL/query construction, error mapping,
decoding via a stubbed `URLProtocol`; we test *our* logic, not Apple's networking. **Codify
it:** `add-endpoint` — how a new API capability enters the app: extend the protocol, implement
in the client, map errors, test the URL and the decode. The "hand it in, don't grab it"
injection rule graduates into `CLAUDE.md` as a project-wide law the assistant now applies
everywhere. **Ledger:** the view stops being a networker. **Trap:** the screen is still one
400-line view.

### Ch 4 — Views That Do One Thing
**Beat:** changing the artwork corner radius breaks the search-field layout. **Extraction:**
decompose the mega-view — `MusicSearchView` owns flow; `TrackRow` and `ArtworkView` render
what they're given. Where `@State` should live; why small view structs are free. **Prove it —
honestly:** pure rendering has no logic to unit test, and the chapter says so; the feedback
tool is **previews**, one per component, with contrived states (longest title, missing
artwork). The itch — "the formatting I *want* to test is still trapped in view code" — is
deliberate. **Codify it:** `extract-subview` — when a view earns extraction (it renders a
concept, not a coincidence), what it receives (values, not sources), and the requirement that
every extracted view ships with its contrived-state previews. **Ledger:** the view stops
rendering every pixel. **Trap:** the view still *thinks* — formatting dates, juggling
`isLoading`/`error`/`results` booleans, deciding what "empty" means.

### Ch 5 — The View Model: Presentation Gets a Home  *(MVVM enters)*
**Beat:** track durations render as `247.0`, release dates as ISO strings, and a
three-`Bool` state tangle produces the famous "loading and error at once" screenshot.
**Extraction:** `MusicSearchViewModel` (`@Observable`) — owns a single `ViewState` enum
(`idle/loading/loaded/empty/failed`), fetches through the injected `SearchClient`, and
transforms `Track` into a display-ready row model: *the view model shapes data for
presentation; the view just renders it.* **Prove it — the book's flagship test moment:** a
fake `SearchClient` drives the view model through every state; assertions run on formatted
output in milliseconds, no simulator. The Ch 1 test the founder couldn't write gets written,
verbatim, and passes. **Codify it:** `add-view-model` — the richest skill yet: the `ViewState`
enum shape, init-injected dependencies, row-model mapping, and the non-negotiable
fake-driven state/formatting test suite. From here on, "make a view model for X" returns the
whole pattern, tests included. **Ledger:** the view stops shaping data and holding screen
logic. **Trap:** there's still only one feature — and a request incoming.

### Ch 6 — The Second Feature: Resist the Copy-Paste
**Beat:** users want podcasts; the founder's cursor hovers over ⌘C — then hovers over the
skills folder instead. **Extraction:** `Podcast` model, `PodcastsView` + `PodcastsViewModel`
+ `PodcastRow`, a `RootView` `TabView`, and feature folders that mean something:
`Features/Music/`, `Features/Podcasts/` (view, view model, rows together — the shape the
sequel will later cut along). The judgment chapter: *share* the client, *duplicate* the rows
— rule of three vs premature abstraction. **Prove it:** the feature ships with its
state-machine + formatting suite; a feature isn't done when it renders, it's done when its
tests pass. **Codify it:** `add-feature` — the book's first *composite* skill: folder layout
plus calls into `add-model`, `add-endpoint`, `add-view-model`, `extract-subview`. Podcasts is
built largely by *invoking* the standards codified so far, and the chapter is transparent
about the division of labor: the skills produce the scaffolding and the tests; the founder
makes the judgment calls (what to share, what to duplicate). Skills encode standards — they
don't replace taste. **Ledger:** the view stops being the whole app. **Trap:** two features
disagree about what "brand blue" is.

### Ch 7 — A Design Language, Not Scattered Constants
**Beat:** a designer friend counts three slightly different blues and four paddings — and the
AI, asked for a new card, invents a fourth blue, because hex literals are all it has ever
seen here. **Extraction:** tokens (`AppColors`, `AppFont`, `AppSpacing`/`AppRadius`) and the
components built from them (`AppText`, `CardView`, `TagView`, `PrimaryButton`) into
`DesignSystem/` — one target-internal folder, deliberately named for what the sequel will one
day make a package. **Prove it — honestly:** tokens are looked at, not asserted on; the
feedback tool is a **preview catalog** rendering every token and component (the embryo of the
sequel's Catalog app). **Codify it:** `add-design-token` / `add-component` — new visual
values enter through tokens, components build only from tokens, every component registers in
the catalog; `CLAUDE.md` gains the rule that bans raw hex/padding literals in feature code.
The AI that invented a blue now refuses to. **Ledger:** the views stop defining the app's
look. **Trap:** a track detail screen just got approved, and nobody owns the word "navigate."

### Ch 8 — Navigation Gets an Owner: The Coordinator  *(the C arrives)*
**Beat:** tap a track → detail screen; a settings sheet; marketing wants a deep link to a
specific track "someday." `NavigationLink`s hard-coded in row views start binding screens to
each other. **Extraction:** `AppCoordinator` (`@Observable`) owns the `NavigationStack` path
and sheet state per tab; views stop navigating and start *reporting intent* ("user tapped
track") via closures the coordinator wires; destinations become an enum the coordinator maps
to screens. View models present, views render, the coordinator steers — **MVVM-C is now
complete and named.** **Prove it:** navigation is just logic now — tests assert that intents
append the right destination, dismissal pops it, and a deep-link URL parses to the right
route. **Codify it:** `add-route` — new destination = enum case + coordinator mapping + intent
closure + route/deep-link tests; `CLAUDE.md` gains "views never construct destinations."
**Ledger:** the views stop deciding where to go next. **Trap:** debugging is still
`print("here 3")`, and the app has no idea what users do.

### Ch 9 — Cross-Cutting Services Behind Contracts
**Beat:** the app misbehaves on a stranger's phone: no logs, no crash reports, no analytics.
**Extraction:** four small protocols — `Logger`, `CrashReporter`, `AnalyticsTracker`,
`FeatureFlagProvider` — with typed `AnalyticsEvent`/`FeatureFlag` vocabularies and console
implementations, selected by a `MOCK_SERVICES` build flag so debug builds never ship real
analytics. Services are *injected through initializers*, same as the `SearchClient` — which
quietly concentrates construction at app startup (the app struct + coordinator), a de facto
assembly point the sequel will one day formalize. **Prove it:** the spy pattern — a
`SpyAnalyticsTracker` records events; tests assert the view model tracks a search and logs a
failure. **Codify it:** `add-analytics-event` / `add-service` — events are typed (a typo
can't invent one), side effects arrive by injection, every new event ships with a spy test.
**Ledger:** the views and view models stop owning side effects. **Trap:** the `.xcodeproj`
just caused its first merge conflict.

### Ch 10 — Project Hygiene: The Invisible Structure
**Beat:** a second developer is about to join; the founder cleans house. **Extraction:** the
project file becomes code — XcodeGen and `project.yml` (where `MOCK_SERVICES` visibly lives);
folder layout as the app's table of contents; `Utilities/` for the boring helpers. **Prove
it:** the suite built across Chs 2–9 becomes infrastructure — one scheme runs every test in
seconds, wired into CI on every push. **Codify it:** `update-project` (how targets, schemes,
and flags change — through `project.yml`, never through Xcode's GUI) — and the payoff of the
whole device: the skill library **is** the onboarding. The second developer's assistant reads
the same `CLAUDE.md` and skills, and their first PR arrives in the house style with tests
attached, judged by CI before a human ever looks. Conventions no longer live in the
founder's head. Plus the restraint sidebar: *"you may be itching for repositories, use cases,
and modules — hold that thought."* **Ledger:** the last row retires. **Trap:** none the
founder can see. That's the point.

### Epilogue — The Well-Built Monolith and Its Limits
Tour the finished app: views render, view models present, the coordinator steers, services
hide behind contracts, the project file is text, every seam earned its tests the day it was
cut, and every convention lives in a skill the whole team — human and AI — builds with. The
ledger is empty; the suite runs in seconds; a new developer ships in the house style on day
one. Then the turn: every boundary in this app is still a *convention*. A skill is a
convention with a helper; tests are a convention with an alarm; but nothing *stops* tomorrow's
tired developer — or a confidently wrong AI — from calling the client inside a view or
importing a feature sideways. The compiler has no opinion about your folders, your rulebook,
or your skills. Measure the baseline scoreboard (clean build, color-change loop, test time)
and hand off: the team is about to grow from two to twenty, and turning these conventions
into *rules the compiler enforces* is the story of **The Modular iOS Playbook**.

## Companion code (not built yet)

Mirror the Playbook's structure: one runnable folder per chapter (`prequel/ch01-one-file-app`
… `prequel/ch10-project-hygiene`), each the end state of its chapter — including its tests
**and its skills**, so both the suite and the skill library visibly grow folder by folder.
The defining acceptance test of the entire two-book arc: the prequel's final folder and the
revised Playbook's `code/ch01` are the same app —

```bash
diff -r prequel/ch10-project-hygiene code/ch01-the-monolith   # → empty (after the Playbook revision)
```
