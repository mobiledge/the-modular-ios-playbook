/// The app's semantic color palette — the foundation of the design system.
///
/// Colors are named for their *role* (brand, surface, text, status), never for
/// their literal hue. A screen asks for `AppColors.textSecondary`, not "gray",
/// so the whole app can be re-themed by editing this one file. Because the
/// neutral surfaces and text colors are backed by Apple's system colors, they
/// adapt to Light and Dark Mode for free.
///
/// MONOLITH NOTE: because this lives in the same target as everything else,
/// any view can use it freely — but there is also nothing stopping unrelated
/// code from depending on it. Chapter 2 extracts these into a Design System
/// module and renames `AppColors` to `DSColors`.
